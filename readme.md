# TSI2F - Tea(m)speak Interface 2 Framework
Faster, better, more extensive ..!

## General informations

Why we develop our own framework when there are many others? Quite simply, to tailor it to the needs that are needed.
The TSI-Framework is now the basic framework for all modules and offers a professional possibility to develop completely detached from the core.

Below you may find some useful links that lead to necessary documentations!

## Doctrine 2 ORM

Doctrine 2 is an object-relational mapper (ORM) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping> for PHP 5.4+ that provides transparent persistence for PHP objects. It uses the Data Mapper pattern at the heart, aiming for a complete separation of your domain/business logic from the persistence in a relational database management system.

The benefit of Doctrine for the programmer is the ability to focus on the object-oriented business logic and worry about persistence only as a secondary problem. This doesn't mean persistence is downplayed by Doctrine 2, however it is our belief that there are considerable benefits for object-oriented programming if persistence and entities are kept separated.
