# DWWE - Php ORM React Framework (Phorm RF)
PHP & React JS efficiently combined

## General informations

Why we develop our own framework when there are many others? Quite simply, to tailor it to the needs that are needed.
The Phorm React Framework offers a professional possibility to develop completely detached from the core.

Below you may find some useful links that lead to necessary documentations!

## Installation

To create a new Phorm RF project using Composer you can use the create-project command. Pass the package name, and the directory to create the project in. You can also provide a version as third argument, otherwise the latest version is used.

```composer create-project dwwe/php-orm-react-framework project-dir```

After the project has been successfully created, install the npm library, change to the project directory and use the command 

```yarn install```

Repeat the same step again in the ```assets/js``` directory, when that's done you can get started!
If you have not installed yarn and npm you can do this here [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Doctrine 2 ORM

Doctrine 2 is an object-relational mapper (ORM) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping> for PHP 5.4+ that provides transparent persistence for PHP objects. It uses the Data Mapper pattern at the heart, aiming for a complete separation of your domain/business logic from the persistence in a relational database management system.

The benefit of Doctrine for the programmer is the ability to focus on the object-oriented business logic and worry about persistence only as a secondary problem. This doesn't mean persistence is downplayed by Doctrine 2, however it is our belief that there are considerable benefits for object-oriented programming if persistence and entities are kept separated.
